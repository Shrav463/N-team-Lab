            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>Karrer Alghazali received his B.S. in Applied Physics from the University of Technology in Baghdad in 2008 and subsequently earned a master's degree in Material Science from the same university in 2010. In August 2018, he obtained a second master's in Applied Science from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. In 2020, he received his Ph.D. in Applied Science with a focus on tissue regeneration, with his doctoral dissertation titled "Novel Material for Advanced Tissue Regeneration." His doctoral studies were marked by major accomplishments in research, publications, and commercialization.</p>
            <p>He is an expert in regenerative medicine, biomedical devices under design control, tissue engineering, bone regeneration, nerve regeneration, and nanosciences. He holds several patents/patent applications in the field of tissue regeneration. His research results have been published and presented in over 24 peer-reviewed articles in leading scientific journals and at international conferences. His publication record includes Scientific Reports (Nature Publisher Group), PLOS ONE, Journal of Nanomedicine: Nanotechnology, Biology and Medicine, Nanomaterials, ACS Applied Bio Materials, Nanoscale, and RSC Advances.</p>
            <p>As a former research manager at a biomedical company, Alghazali has a strong bioengineering industrial background as an R&D professional and scientist. He has a proven track record in steering the end-to-end new product development lifecycle from conceptualization to successful market launch. Recognized for continuously refining processes through adept program management and strategic insights, he excels in leading cross-functional teams in pioneering research and development initiatives, particularly in advanced materials for biomedical applications. His biomedical device development research was funded by NIH, where he is the principal investigator of two NIH-SBIR-STTR financed projects.</p>
